# First-Repo
## This is my first repository
*Today I'm trying to learn how to use MarkDown in the most efficient way possible, with as much as possible usage of the same*

**But why??**
There are number of reasons why and I'll list few of them Here
1. The markdown makes it easier for people using git to understand what the code is all about.
2. There is a set of equipment to make the text look engaging and attractive.
3. As you can see with this list feature, Though we have Unordered lists as well,

- for example, this one
- and i can go on forever

## We can add Links and Images to do the same.

  print("Hii, Guys!")
```
## the end
