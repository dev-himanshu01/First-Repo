# First-Repo
## This is my first repository
*Today I'm trying to learn how to use MarkDown in the most efficient way possible with as much as possible usage of the same*

**But why??**
There are number of reasons why and, I'll list few of them here
1. The markdown makes it easier for the people using git to understand what the code is all about.
2. There are set of equipments to make the text look engaging and attractive.
3. As you can find our with this list feature. Though we have Unordered lists as well

- for example this one
- and i can go on forever

def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
```
